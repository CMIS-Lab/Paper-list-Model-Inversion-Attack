## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as a curated collection of academic papers focusing on **attack methods and defense mechanisms** in machine learning. Our goal is to provide researchers, practitioners, and students with a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in this critical security domain.

## What is the model inversion attack?

A model inversion attack is a privacy attack where the attacker is able to reconstruct the original samples that were used to train the synthetic model from the generated synthetic data set. (Mostly.ai)

The goal of model inversion attacks is to recreate training data or sensitive attributes.
(Chen et al, 2021.)

In model inversion attacks, a malicious user attempts to recover the private dataset used to train a supervised neural network. A successful model inversion attack should generate realistic and diverse samples that accurately describe each of the classes in the private dataset. (Wang et al, 2021.)
