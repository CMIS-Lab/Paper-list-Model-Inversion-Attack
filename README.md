## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as a curated collection of academic papers focusing on **attack methods and defense mechanisms** in machine learning. Our goal is to provide researchers, practitioners, and students with a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in this critical security domain.

## 💡What is the model inversion attack?

A model inversion attack is a privacy attack where the attacker is able to reconstruct the original samples that were used to train the synthetic model from the generated synthetic data set. (Mostly.ai)

The goal of model inversion attacks is to recreate training data or sensitive attributes.
(Chen et al, 2021.)

In model inversion attacks, a malicious user attempts to recover the private dataset used to train a supervised neural network. A successful model inversion attack should generate realistic and diverse samples that accurately describe each of the classes in the private dataset. (Wang et al, 2021.)

* **[2025.04.28]** **[Diffusion-Driven Universal Model Inversion Attack for Face Recognition](https://openreview.net/forum?id=s56xikpD92)** ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CVPR'25-6c757d)(![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/CCF_A-dc3545)) 
  * Hanrui Wang , Shuo Wang , Chun-Shien Lu , Isao Echizen
  * **📝 Summary**: This paper propose a novel method called DiffUMI, a training-free diffusion-driven universal model inversion attack for face recognition systems. DiffUMI is the first approach to apply a                           diffusion model for unconditional image generation in model inversion.
  * **💡 Motivation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Solved the critical challenges of relying on datasets for training, poor open-set adaptability, and limited reconstruction quality.
  * **🔧 Method**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - The methods include DiffUMI and OODD. DiffUMI adapts to any open-set face recognition model through a fixed framework, innovatively analyzes the impact of latent codes, proposes a highly reliable latent code selection method, and introduces a ranking adversary strategy to optimize attack effectiveness. OODD distinguishes between face and non-face inputs solely based on feature embeddings.
